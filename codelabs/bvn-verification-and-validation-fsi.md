# Performing BVN Verification and Validation using the NIBSS FSI Sandbox

## Overview

Duration: 1

In this codelab, we shall be taking a look at how to perform actions such as BVN verification and validation using the FSI Sandbox API by constructing a wrapper API around it.

A live example of what we will build is available at: `https://dsc-fsi-wrapper.herokuapp.com/api`

Negative
: **N/B:** The sandbox API is restricted and only provides a simulation of what the actual API works like. Therefore, only data present in the sandbox can be used, this includes BVNs and user data.
